This project shows a graph simulation that draws math functions on a graph.
The user can type an equation in the form y = f(x) to see the graph.
The project supports functions like sine, cosine, tangent, square root, absolute value, logarithm, and powers.
The graph can be moved by dragging and zoomed in or out by scrolling.
This project helps in learning math functions and understanding how their graphs look.
